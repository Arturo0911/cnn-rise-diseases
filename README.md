# Convolution Neural Networks for Rice diseases



## Introduction:

Oryza Sative L. is on the most important staple plants
in the world (Londo et al. 2006)


## Classification process (CNN)

This step is to carry out the learning process to get
the best model in the classification of the leaf photo
image. In this study the CNN method is used for classfi-
cation. However, before entering into the CNN method, 
preprocessing is done to the leaf photo data that has
been obtained, namely dividin the data into 76% for
training data and 24% for testing data. Training data is 
used to find the best classification model based on image
input data and original classification results. Then, to
test whether the model is good, we use data testing. The
CNN process is presented.

## Convolution Layer
The fundamental purpose of convolution is to extract
features from te input picture. Convolution uses a small
square matrix, which preserves the spation relationships
among pixels, to learn image features. The matrix that
slides the filter on the original image and performs the
convolution operations is called the feature map.


For evert feature map, all neurons shared the same
weight parameter that is known as filter or kernel.
The filter is a feature detector for the original 
input picure. Different filters will produce different
feature maps for the same picture. By simply adjusting
the filter values, we can perform effects syuch as 
edge detection, sharpening, blurring, etc. That mean
different filters detect diffeten features., such as 
edges curves, etc, from the picture



# Btach Normalization

Also know as "Batch norm" is a method common used to make training
of artificial neural networks faster and more stable through normalization
of the layers input's by re-centering and re-scaling.
